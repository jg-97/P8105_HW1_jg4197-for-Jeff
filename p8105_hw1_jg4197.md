# Problem 1

## Problem 1.1

``` r
# open a library
library(tidyverse)

# make sure the reproducibility
set.seed(10)

# create a data frame
p1_df <- tibble(
  ran_samp = rnorm(8),
  vec_log = ran_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("Problem", "1", "is","about", "writing", "a", "data", "frame"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("0", "0", "0", "1", "1", "1", "1", "2"))
)

# calculate the mean
mean(pull(p1_df, ran_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.3779272

Only `ran_samp` is a set of numbers and can be calculated for the mean.
`vec_log`, `vec_char`, `vec_factor` does not work in the mean
calculation.

## Problem 1.2

``` r
* Problem 1.2.1
# convert logistic to numeric and multiply by ran_samp
covt_log_num <- as.numeric(pull(p1_df, vec_log))
pull(p1_df, ran_samp) * covt_log_num

* Problem 1.2.2
# convert logistic to factor and multiply by ran_samp
covt_log_fact <- as.factor(pull(p1_df, vec_log))
pull(p1_df, ran_samp) * covt_log_fact

* Problem 1.2.3
# convert logistic to factor to numeric and multiply by ran_samp
covt_log_fact_numeric <- as.numeric(
  as.factor(pull(p1_df, vec_log))
)
pull(p1_df, ran_samp) * covt_log_fact_numeric
```

Only **Problem 1.2.1** and **Problem 1.2.3** can multiply with
`ran_samp` since they have been converted to numeric vectors. **Problem
1.2.2** is converted to be a factor vector which cannot multiply with a
numeric vector and thus the result is 8 NA meaning no content.

# Problem 2

``` r
# make sure the reproducibility
set.seed(500)

# create a data frame
p2_df <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  vec_log = x + y > 1,
  vec_num = as.numeric(vec_log),
  vec_fact = as.factor(vec_log)
)

# make a scatterplot with color by logistic vector
ggplot(p2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_log)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
## Comment: The numeric vector is continuous and thus the scale shows a range of same color to display the points

# make a scatterplot with color by factor vector
ggplot(p2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_fact)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
## Comment: The factor vector has two levels corresponding to logistic vector and thus the scale shows points with two different colors
```

The size of `p2_df` is 500 and 5.

The mean of `x` is -0.0455615.

The median of `x` is -0.0385267.

The standard deviation of `x` is 1.0165813.

The proportion of `vec_log` is 0.22 and 0.78.
